Loans account for a large portion of bank profits. Despite the fact that many people are looking for loans, finding a legitimate applicant who will return the loan is difficult. Banks must determine if the borrower will be able to repay the loan. It is crucial to know whether or not the borrower is going to be in safe hands. Therefore, machine learning model is created to predict whether or not the customer would repay the loan.

## Objective
In the given problem statement, parameters like Gender, marriage, number of dependents, Education, Self  Employment, Applicant Income, Co-applicant Income, Loan Amount, Property Area, Loan Amount Term and Credit History are used to determine whether the person should be lend loan or not. The data is visualized and a machine learning model is developed to predict loans.
